# REST Navigator

![build status](https://travis-ci.org/deontologician/rest_navigator.png?branch=master)

REST Navigator is a python library for interacting with
([level 3](http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html#level3))
HTTP REST (hypermedia) apis with some defined hyperlinking relations. Initially,
it only supports [HAL+JSON](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-05)
but it should be general enough to extend to other formats eventually. Its first
goal is to make interacting with HAL hypermedia apis as painless as possible,
while discouraging REST anti-patterns.

# How to use it

To begin interacting with a HAL api, you've got to create a HALNavigator that
points to the api root. Ideally, in a hypermedia API, the root URL is the only
URL that needs to be hardcoded in your application. All other URLs are obtained
from the api responses themselves (think of your api client as 'clicking on
links', rather than having the urls hardcoded).

As an example, we'll connect to the haltalk api.

```python
>>> from rest_navigator import HALNavigator
>>> N = HALNavigator('http://haltalk.herokuapp.com/', apiname="haltalk")
>>> N
HALNavigator(haltalk)
```

Usually, with the index (normally at the api root), you're most interested in
the links. Let's look at those:

```python
>>> N.links
{'ht:users': [HALNavigator(haltalk.users)],
 'ht:signup': [HALNavigator(haltalk.signup)],
 'ht:me': [HALNavigator(haltalk.users.{name})],
 'ht:latest-posts': [HALNavigator(haltalk.posts.latest)]
}
```

(This may take a moment because asking for the links causes the HALNavigator to
actually request the resource from the server).

Here we can see that the links are organized by their relation type (the key),
and each key corresponds to a new HALNavigator that represents some other
resource. Relation types are extremely important in restful apis: we need them
to be able to determine what a link means in relation to the current resource,
in a way that is automatable.

In addition, the root has some state associated with it which you can get in two
different ways:

```python
>>> N() # cached state of resource (obtained when we looked at N.links)
{u'hint_1': u'You need an account to post stuff..',
 u'hint_2': u'Create one by POSTing via the ht:signup link..',
 u'hint_3': u'Click the orange buttons on the right to make POST requests..',
 u'hint_4': u'Click the green button to follow a link with a GET request..',
 u'hint_5': u'Click the book icon to read docs for the link relation.',
 u'welcome': u'Welcome to a haltalk server.'}
>>> N.fetch() # will refetch the resource from the server
{u'hint_1': u'You need an account to post stuff..',
 u'hint_2': u'Create one by POSTing via the ht:signup link..',
 u'hint_3': u'Click the orange buttons on the right to make POST requests..',
 u'hint_4': u'Click the green button to follow a link with a GET request..',
 u'hint_5': u'Click the book icon to read docs for the link relation.',
 u'welcome': u'Welcome to a haltalk server.'}
```

Calling a HALNavigator will execute a GET request against the resource and
returns its value (which it will cache).

Let's register a hal talk account. Unfortunately, we don't really know how to do
that, so let's look at the documentation. The `ht:signup` link looks promising,
let's check that:

```python
>>> N.docsfor('ht:signup')
# a browser opens http://haltalk.herokuapp.com/rels/signup
```

What? Popping up a browser from a library call? Yes, that's how rest_navigator
rolls. You see, the docs are for humans, and while custom rel-types are URIs,
they shouldn't automatically be dereferenced by a program that interacts with
the api. So popping up a browser serves two purposes:

  1. It allows easy access to the documentation at the time when you most need
  it: when you're mucking about in the command line trying to figure out how to
  interact with the api.
  2. It reminds you not to try to automatically dereference the rel
  documentation and parse it in your application.

If you need a more robust way to browse the api and the documentation,
[HAL Browser](https://github.com/mikekelly/hal-browser) is probably your best
bet.

The docs for `ht:signup` explain the format of the POST request to sign up. So
let's actually sign up (Note: haltalk is a toy api for example purposes, don't
ever send plaintext passwords over an unencrypted connection in a real app!):

```python
>>> fred23 = N['ht:signup'].create(
... {'username': 'fred23',
...  'password': 'some_passwd',
...  'real_name': 'Fred 23'}
... )
>>> fred23
HALNavigator(haltalk.users.fred23)
```

If the user name had already been in use, a 400 would have been returned from
the haltalk api. Using the Zen of Python guideline "Errors should never pass
silently." an exception would have been raised on a 400 or 500 status code. You
can squelch this exception and just have the post call return a HALNavigator
with a 400/500 status code if you want:

```python
>>> dup_signup = N['ht:signup'].create({
...    'username': 'fred23',
...    'password': 'pwnme',
...    'real_name': 'Fred Wilson'
... }, raise_exc=False)
>>> dup_signup
HALNavigator(haltalk.signup)  # 400!
>>> dup_signup.status
(400, 'Bad Request')
>>> dup_signup.state
{"errors": {"username": ["is already taken"]}}
```

Now that we've signed up, lets take a look at our profile. The link for a user's
profile is a templated link, which we can tell because its repr has a '*'
character after it. You can also tell by the .parameters attribute:

```python
>>> N.links.keys()
['ht:latest-posts', 'ht:me', 'ht:users', 'ht:signup']
>>> N['ht:me']
HALNavigator(haltalk.users.{name})
>>> N['ht:me'].parameters
set(['name'])
```

The documentation for the `ht:me` rel type should tell us how the name parameter
is supposed to work, but in this case it's fairly obvious (plug in the
username). There are two ways you can input template parameters. Both are
equivalent, but people may prefer one over the other for aesthetic reasons:

```python
>>> N['ht:me'].template_uri
'http://haltalk.herokuapp.com/users/{name}'
>>> Nme_v1 = N['ht:me', 'name':'fred23']
>>> Nme_v1
HALNavigator('haltalk.users.fred24')
>>> Nme_v2 = N['ht:me'].expand(name='fred23')  # equivalent to Nme_v1
>>> Nme_v2()
{'bio': None, 'real_name': 'Fred Wilson', 'username': 'fred23'}
```

In order to post something to haltalk, we need to authenticate with our newly
created account. HALNavigator allows any authentication method that
[requests](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#custom-authentication)
supports (so OAuth etc). For basic auth (which haltalk uses), we can just pass a
tuple.

```python
>>> N.authenticate(('fred23', 'pwnme'))
```

Now we can actually create a new post:

```python
>>> N_post = N['ht:me', 'name':'fred23']['ht:posts'].create({'content': 'My first post'})
>>> N_post
HALNavigator(Haltalk.posts[523670eff0e6370002000001])
>>> N_post()
{'content': 'My first post', 'created_at': '2013-06-26T03:19:52+00:00'}
```

## More:

* You don't need to worry about inadvertently having two different navigators
  pointing to the same resource. Both will use the same underlying representation
* If a resource has a link with the rel "next", the navigator for that resource
  can be used as a python iterator. It will automatically raise a StopIteration
  exception if a resource in the chain does not have a next link. This makes
  moving through paged resources really simple and pythonic.
* You can grab HTTP response headers with the `N.response.headers` attribute
* You can grab your current session's headers with `N.session.headers`

## Testing
To run tests, first install the [pytest framework](http://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html):

```
$ pip install -U pytest
```

To run tests, execute following from the root of the source directory:

```
$ py.test
```

## Planned for the future
* Specifying a curie as a default namespace. As long as the curie is defined on
  the resource you want, you don't need to specify it when indexing link rels
* Ability to add hooks for different types, rels and profiles. If a link has one
  of these properties, it will call your hook when doing a server call.
* Take advantage of the "HTTP caching pattern" for embedded resources, and will
  treat embedded documents as permission not to dereference a link. Rest
  navigator handles this seamlessly underneath, so you don't have to worry about
  whether a resource is embedded or not.
* Since HAL doesn't specify what content type POSTs, PUTs, and PATCHes need to
  have, you can specify the hooks based on what the server will accept. This can
  trigger off either the rel type of the link, or rest navigator can do content
  negotiation over HTTP with the server directly to see what content types that
  resource will accept.
